        <h1>Understanding Smartphone Displays</h1>
        <p>The display is one of the key features of any smartphone, affecting how users interact with their device. In this section, we'll explore the different types of displays, their resolutions, refresh rates, and various advanced technologies that enhance the viewing experience.</p>

        <!-- Display Type -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Display Type</h2>
                <p><strong>OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode):</strong> OLED displays offer vibrant colors, deep blacks, and energy efficiency. Each pixel can turn off individually, allowing for perfect black levels. OLED displays also have faster response times and better contrast ratios, making them a premium choice for higher-end smartphones.</p>
                <p><strong>IPS LCD (In-Plane Switching Liquid Crystal Display):</strong> IPS LCDs offer good color accuracy and wide viewing angles, making them a solid choice for mid-range smartphones. While the black levels aren't as deep as OLEDs, these displays are cost-effective and commonly used in affordable devices.</p>
                <p><strong>AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED):</strong> An enhanced version of OLED, AMOLED improves brightness and power consumption by using individually addressed pixels. This technology is often seen in high-end smartphones and offers excellent color accuracy and power efficiency.</p>

        <!-- Resolution -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Resolution</h2>
                <p><strong>Full HD (1080p):</strong> This resolution is common in mid-range devices and provides sharp visuals while being more energy-efficient compared to higher resolutions.</p>
                <p><strong>Quad HD (1440p):</strong> A higher resolution that offers even sharper details, typically found in premium devices. Quad HD is great for users who want the best possible screen clarity.</p>
                <p><strong>4K:</strong> Though rarely necessary for smartphones, 4K resolution can be found in select high-end models, offering extremely sharp visuals, especially for media consumption.</p>

        <!-- Refresh Rate -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Refresh Rate (Hz)</h2>
                <p><strong>60Hz:</strong> Standard refresh rate found in most budget and mid-range smartphones. It provides smooth visuals for everyday tasks but lacks the fluidity seen in higher-end models.</p>
                <p><strong>90Hz/120Hz/144Hz:</strong> These higher refresh rates offer smoother animations and interactions, which are particularly beneficial for gaming, scrolling, and multitasking. 120Hz is quickly becoming the standard for flagship devices.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Touch Sampling Rate -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Touch Sampling Rate</h2>
                <p>The touch sampling rate refers to how quickly the screen can register touches. A higher touch sampling rate (e.g., 240Hz or 360Hz) improves the responsiveness, particularly in fast-paced gaming or precise screen interactions.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Peak Brightness -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Peak Brightness</h2>
                <p><strong>Nits:</strong> The unit used to measure brightness. Higher peak brightness ensures better visibility in direct sunlight, and flagship devices may reach 800-1200 nits for normal usage. For HDR content, peak brightness can be even higher.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Brightness:</strong> General brightness for everyday use is typically between 300-600 nits, adequate for most conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>HDR Peak Brightness:</strong> Displays with HDR capabilities often reach brightness levels above 1000 nits, allowing for superior contrast and color depth in HDR content.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-image">

        <!-- HDR -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>HDR (High Dynamic Range)</h2>
                <p><strong>HDR10:</strong> The standard for enhanced dynamic range, improving contrast and color depth. Many smartphones feature HDR10 support for better media consumption.</p>
                <p><strong>Dolby Vision:</strong> A more advanced HDR format offering superior brightness, contrast, and color accuracy compared to HDR10. Some high-end smartphones support Dolby Vision for an enhanced viewing experience.</p>

        <!-- Aspect Ratio -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Aspect Ratio</h2>
                <p>Aspect ratio refers to the width and height proportions of the display (e.g., 16:9, 19.5:9, 21:9). Higher aspect ratios, like 20:9 or 21:9, result in taller displays, offering more space for content such as videos and apps.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Screen Protection -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Screen Protection</h2>
                <p><strong>Gorilla Glass:</strong> A popular toughened glass that helps protect displays from scratches and drops. Some devices also include anti-scratch coatings for additional protection.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Curved or Flat Display -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Curved or Flat Display</h2>
                <p><strong>Curved Displays:</strong> These displays offer a more immersive, edge-to-edge look, often used in high-end devices. However, they may be prone to accidental touches.</p>
                <p><strong>Flat Displays:</strong> A more practical option, flat displays are common in mid-range devices, providing a simpler user experience with fewer accidental touches.</p>
            </div>
