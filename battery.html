        <h1>Understanding Smartphone Batteries</h1>
        <p>The battery is a critical component of any smartphone, determining how long you can use your device on a single charge. Below, we dive into the key aspects of smartphone batteries to help you make an informed decision when choosing your next device.</p>

        <!-- Battery Capacity -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Battery Capacity (mAh)</h2>
                <p>Measured in <strong>milliampere-hours (mAh)</strong>, this indicates the energy storage capacity of the battery. A higher mAh generally means a longer battery life.</p>
                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> For all-day usage, a capacity of 4000-6000mAh is recommended, depending on your usage patterns.</p>

        <!-- Battery Type -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Battery Type</h2>
                <p><strong>Lithium-ion (Li-ion):</strong> The most common battery type in smartphones, offering good energy density, fast charging, and durability.</p>
                <p><strong>Lithium Polymer (Li-Po):</strong> Lightweight and flexible, though it may degrade slightly faster than Li-ion batteries.</p>
                <p><strong>Silicon-Ion Batteries:</strong> A newer technology emerging in smartphones. These offer higher energy density, providing better battery life in a smaller form factor, but they are still in early development stages.</p>

        <!-- Battery Optimization Software -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Battery Optimization Software</h2>
                <p>Modern smartphones use software to enhance battery life by managing background processes and power-hungry features.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Android’s Adaptive Battery learns your usage patterns to optimize power consumption.</li>
                    <li>iPhone’s Optimized Battery Charging reduces long-term wear by slowing charging overnight.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Battery Longevity -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Battery Longevity (Charge Cycles)</h2>
                <p>Smartphone batteries typically last for 300-500 charge cycles before noticeable capacity loss.</p>
                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Devices with features like trickle charging or customizable charging limits that help preserve battery health over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-image">
                <img src="images/battery-longevity.jpg" alt="Battery charge cycles">
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Real-World Performance -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Real-World Performance</h2>
                <p>Beyond the specs, real-world battery performance matters. Look for reviews discussing screen-on-time (SoT) and how the phone handles heavy use, such as gaming or multitasking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-image">
