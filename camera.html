        <h1>Understanding Smartphone Cameras</h1>
        <p>The camera is one of the most important aspects of a smartphone, and its capabilities have significantly advanced over time. Below we cover the key elements that make up a modern smartphone camera, from sensor types to image processing features.</p>

        <!-- Camera Sensor -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Camera Sensor</h2>
                <p><strong>Resolution (Megapixels):</strong> The resolution of a camera is measured in megapixels, indicating the number of pixels the sensor can capture. More megapixels typically lead to sharper images with more detail. However, the quality of the photo doesn't solely depend on megapixels; sensor size and processing power play vital roles too.</p>
                <p><strong>Sensor Size:</strong> The size of the camera sensor significantly affects the quality of the image. Larger sensors (e.g., 1-inch or 1/1.7-inch) capture more light, which is critical for producing high-quality photos in low light. Larger sensors allow for more light, detail, and better dynamic range, enhancing the overall image quality.</p>
                <p><strong>Sensor Type:</strong> Common smartphone camera sensors include <strong>CMOS</strong> (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) and <strong>stacked CMOS</strong>. Stacked CMOS sensors, in particular, offer faster readout speeds and enhanced performance, especially when recording video at high frame rates or capturing images in low-light conditions.</p>

        <!-- Lens -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Lens</h2>
                <p><strong>Aperture (f/Number):</strong> The aperture controls the amount of light that enters the camera lens. The f-number (e.g., f/1.8) describes the aperture size, with smaller numbers allowing more light for better low-light performance. A larger aperture is ideal for producing a shallow depth of field (blurry background) for portrait shots.</p>
                <p><strong>Focal Length:</strong> The focal length determines the field of view and zoom capabilities of the camera. Common focal lengths are ultrawide, wide, and telephoto. An ultrawide lens captures more of the scene, ideal for landscapes, while telephoto lenses zoom in on distant objects for high-quality close-up shots.</p>
                <p><strong>Lens Coating:</strong> High-end smartphones often include lens coatings that reduce glare, reflections, and ghosting. These coatings improve the clarity and sharpness of your images, particularly when shooting in bright light or when using long exposures.</p>

        <!-- Camera Modes -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Camera Modes</h2>
                <p><strong>Wide, Ultrawide, and Telephoto:</strong> Smartphone cameras often include multiple lenses, each with different focal lengths. The standard wide lens is great for general photography, while the ultrawide lens captures a larger scene, perfect for group shots and landscapes. The telephoto lens enables zoomed-in shots without sacrificing image quality.</p>
                <p><strong>Macro Lens:</strong> A macro lens allows users to capture highly detailed close-up shots of small objects, such as flowers or insects. This lens can focus at a very short distance, bringing out intricate details that would otherwise be missed by standard lenses.</p>
                <p><strong>Depth Sensors or ToF Sensors:</strong> Depth sensors (Time-of-Flight sensors) help smartphones capture depth information for portrait mode shots, enhancing the background blur effect (bokeh). These sensors work by measuring the distance between the sensor and the subject, enabling the camera to distinguish the subject from the background more accurately.</p>

        <!-- Image Stabilization -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Image Stabilization</h2>
                <p><strong>Optical Image Stabilization (OIS):</strong> OIS helps to reduce motion blur caused by hand shake during photo capture, especially in low light or when using the telephoto lens. OIS physically adjusts the lens or sensor to compensate for hand movements, ensuring clearer images.</p>
                <p><strong>Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS):</strong> EIS, on the other hand, uses software to stabilize video footage by cropping and adjusting frames. While EIS is more common in video, it doesn’t require any specialized hardware and can work with a wide range of camera sensors.</p>

        <!-- Zoom Capabilities -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Zoom Capabilities</h2>
                <p><strong>Optical Zoom:</strong> Optical zoom is achieved by physically adjusting the lens to zoom in, maintaining image quality. This type of zoom doesn’t lose resolution and is essential for getting close-up shots of distant objects.</p>
                <p><strong>Digital Zoom:</strong> Digital zoom, however, crops the image and magnifies it using software, leading to a reduction in image quality as you zoom in.</p>
                <p><strong>Hybrid Zoom:</strong> Hybrid zoom combines the advantages of both optical and digital zoom. While optical zoom maintains the quality of the image, hybrid zoom can extend this range by using software enhancements, giving you clearer zoomed-in shots without too much loss of quality.</p>

        <!-- Software and Processing -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Software and Processing</h2>
                <p><strong>AI Enhancements:</strong> Many modern smartphones use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance image quality. AI helps with scene recognition, adjusting exposure, contrast, and color balance, ensuring optimal photo quality in different lighting conditions and scenarios.</p>
                <p><strong>HDR (High Dynamic Range):</strong> HDR technology allows the camera to capture more detail in both dark and bright areas by taking multiple shots at different exposure levels and combining them into one balanced image. This is particularly useful in high-contrast environments like sunset or daylight photography.</p>
                <p><strong>RAW Format Support:</strong> For photographers who want more control over post-processing, RAW format support allows capturing unprocessed images with maximum detail. RAW images allow you to adjust elements like exposure, white balance, and sharpness with greater flexibility than JPEG files.</p>

        <!-- Video Features -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Video Features</h2>
                <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Modern smartphones support video recording in 4K, 8K, and Full HD resolution. The higher the resolution, the more detail you can capture, though 4K is generally sufficient for most users.</p>
                <p><strong>Slow Motion:</strong> Slow-motion videos are achieved by capturing footage at higher frame rates, such as 120fps or 240fps. This allows you to slow down fast-moving subjects, creating smooth and dramatic effects.</p>
                <p><strong>Cinematic Mode:</strong> Cinematic Mode uses AI to add a depth-of-field effect in videos, mimicking the professional look of DSLR or mirrorless camera footage. It adjusts the focus and blur, making the video appear more polished and film-like.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Front Camera -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Front Camera</h2>
                <p>The front camera is optimized for selfies, video calls, and front-facing photography. Like the rear camera, it includes features like wide-angle lenses, night mode, and AI beautification. Modern front cameras can capture high-quality 1080p or even 4K video.</p>
                <p>Some smartphones include a screen flash feature, illuminating the screen to act as a soft flash in low-light conditions, ensuring clearer and brighter selfies.</p>

        <!-- Additional Features -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Additional Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Periscope Lens:</strong> Provides high optical zoom in a compact design, useful for getting closer to subjects without losing image quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dual or Triple Camera Setup:</strong> Allows for more versatility with multiple lenses, such as combining wide, telephoto, and ultrawide lenses for different shooting scenarios.</li>
