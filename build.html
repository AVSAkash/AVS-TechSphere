                <h2>Materials Used in Smartphone Construction</h2>
                <p><strong>ðŸª¶ Plastic (Polycarbonate):</strong> Common in budget and mid-range smartphones. Itâ€™s lightweight, cost-effective, and resistant to scratches, but it lacks the premium feel of other materials and can crack under pressure. Example: Samsung Galaxy A series, Xiaomi Redmi series.</p>
                <p><strong>ðŸ”© Aluminum (Metal):</strong> Found in mid-range to premium smartphones. Offers a premium look, is durable, and resists bending. However, it can scratch more easily. Example: iPhone 14, OnePlus 11, Google Pixel 7.</p>
                <p><strong>ðŸªž Glass:</strong> Found in flagship phones, glass is sleek, glossy, and supports wireless charging, but itâ€™s fragile and prone to fingerprints. Example: Samsung Galaxy S series,Google pixel.</p>
                <p><strong>ðŸ”² Ceramic:</strong> Rare, used in high-end smartphones. Ceramic is highly scratch-resistant, has a premium feel, but can still crack under impact. Example: iPhones , Vivo X series.</p>

                <h2>Vegan Leather in Smartphones</h2>
                <p><strong>What is Vegan Leather?</strong> Vegan leather is a sustainable alternative to traditional leather made from plant-based materials like pineapple fibers, apple peels, cactus, or mushrooms. It's a cruelty-free, eco-friendly option with a premium feel.</p>
                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Vegan leather is eco-friendly, stylish, and durable. It provides a luxurious, textured finish without the environmental impact of traditional leather. However, it may not last as long as real leather.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of Vegan Leather in Smartphones:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4: Vegan leather back on select editions.</li>
                        <li>Realme GT Master Edition: Vegan leather for a high-end look.</li>
                        <li>Motorola Edge Series: Vegan leather edition for an eco-conscious approach.</li>
                    </ul>

            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Water and Dust Resistance (IP Rating)</h2>
                <p><strong>IP Rating (Ingress Protection):</strong> IP ratings show how well a device resists dust and water. A higher number means better protection.</p>
                <p><strong>IP67:</strong> Dustproof and can survive submersion in 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. Example: Google Pixel 7, Samsung Galaxy A54.</p>
                <p><strong>IP68:</strong> More water-resistant, with protection against submersion in more than 1 meter of water. Example: Samsung Galaxy S25, iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>
                <p><strong>IP69:</strong> Complete dustproof and high-pressure water-resistant. Found in rugged phones for industrial use. Example: Cat S62 Pro, Oppo F27+.</p>

        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Design Features</h2>
                <p><strong>ðŸ’§ Slim vs. Rugged:</strong> Slim phones are lightweight and comfortable to carry but less durable. Rugged phones are bulkier, built for harsh environments, offering superior durability. Example: iPhone 15 vs. Cat S62 Pro.</p>
                <p><strong>ðŸ”² Notch vs. Hole-punch vs. Full-Screen Design:</strong> Notches and hole-punch designs minimize screen real estate but are now replaced by full-screen displays with under-display cameras for an uninterrupted experience. Example: iPhone X (Notch), Samsung Galaxy S20 (Hole-punch), Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 (Full-Screen).</p>
