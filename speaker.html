        <h1>Understanding Smartphone Speakers</h1>
        <p>Speakers play a crucial role in multimedia experiences, affecting music, calls, gaming, and video quality. Let's explore the different speaker types, sound technologies, and enhancements in modern smartphones.</p>

        <!-- Speaker Types -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Speaker Types</h2>
                <p><strong>📢 Single Speaker (Mono):</strong> Found in budget and some mid-range phones, a single speaker (usually at the bottom) provides basic sound but lacks stereo separation.</p>
                <p><strong>🔊 Dual Speakers (Stereo):</strong> A combination of bottom-firing and earpiece speakers offers a louder and more immersive experience, now common in mid-range and flagship devices.</p>
                <p><strong>🔊🔊 Dedicated Dual Front-Facing Speakers:</strong> Found in gaming phones like ASUS ROG Phone, both speakers are placed on the front for direct, immersive sound.</p>
                <p><strong>🎵 Quad Speakers:</strong> Rare in smartphones but present in some gaming phones and tablets, providing a surround-sound-like experience.</p>

        <!-- Sound Technologies -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Sound Technologies & Enhancements</h2>
                <p><strong>🎧 Dolby Atmos:</strong> Creates a 3D surround effect, making sound feel spacious and immersive. Found in flagship devices like iPhones, Samsung Galaxy S-series, and OnePlus flagships.</p>
                <p><strong>🎚️ Hi-Res Audio:</strong> Delivers high-quality audio with wired or premium Bluetooth headphones. Phones with Hi-Res Audio certification provide better sound for audiophiles.</p>
                <p><strong>🎵 DTS:X Ultra:</strong> Similar to Dolby Atmos but more common in gaming phones, enhancing spatial audio for gaming and movies.</p>
                <p><strong>📣 Smart Amplifiers (Smart AMP):</strong> Increases speaker volume without distortion, preventing damage while maintaining clarity. Common in flagship and gaming phones.</p>

        <!-- Loudness & Clarity -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Loudness & Clarity (Measured in dB)</h2>
                <p>Speaker loudness is measured in decibels (dB), with clarity being equally important:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Budget phones:</strong> ~70-80 dB</li>
                    <li><strong>Mid-range phones:</strong> 80-90 dB</li>
                    <li><strong>Flagship phones:</strong> 90+ dB (e.g., iPhone 15, Galaxy S-series)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Audio Jack & Bluetooth Audio -->
        <div class="feature-section">
            <div class="feature-text">
                <h2>Audio Jack & Bluetooth Audio</h2>
                <p><strong>🎧 3.5mm Headphone Jack:</strong> While most flagship phones have removed it, budget and gaming phones often retain the 3.5mm jack for wired audio lovers.</p>
                <p><strong>🎵 Bluetooth Audio (Codec Support):</strong> Wireless audio quality depends on the supported codec:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SBC/AAC:</strong> Basic audio, found in most Bluetooth headphones.</li>
                    <li><strong>LDAC:</strong> High-resolution audio, mainly supported by Sony devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>aptX/aptX HD:</strong> Higher-quality audio for gaming and music, supported on some Snapdragon-powered phones.</li>
                </ul>
